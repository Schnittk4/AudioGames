AudioGames
A lot of code. Made four directional binaural panner without HRTF
Tried using nodes but ran into difficulties. Would have had to repatch everything, so sticking to pict slider
Main patch I'm working on atm is isoGameTry. 
Trying to figure out how to have several panners working as sound sources in one space
