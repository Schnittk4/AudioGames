# A lot of code. Made four directional binaural panner without HRTF
# Tried using nodes but ran into difficulties. Would have had to repatch everything, so sticking to pict slider
# Main patch I'm working on atm is isoGameTry. 
# Trying to figure out how to have several panners working as sound sources in one space
## Used Nodes to orient in space instead of pict slider in latest iteration (nodesWorkingWYupdate)
## Works poorly with less complex sounds
